# Distracted-driver-detection
Distracted driver detection using deep learning
Acccidents are mainly caused due to the driver distraction so in this project we predict the driver behaviour through images of the driver.
the set of images are classified into 10 categories.
c0: safe driving

c1: texting - right

c2: talking on the phone - right

c3: texting - left

c4: talking on the phone - left

c5: operating the radio

c6: drinking

c7: reaching behind

c8: hair and makeup

c9: talking to passenger
using cnn(VGG16) we can predict and classify the image to the above categories.
Also Used the TransferLearning and FineTuningStrategies.
